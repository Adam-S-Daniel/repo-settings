This block is deliberately short. It carries the things that are **specific to
this account and learned the hard way** — incidents, fleet policy, machine
layout. It does not restate general engineering practice, and it does not
describe anything you can learn by reading the repo. Depth lives in each repo's
`docs/` and in the skills registry; follow the pointers when the work touches
that area.

## Working in these repos

- Fix what was asked. No speculative features, premature abstractions, or
  unused helpers.
- Prefer editing an existing file over creating a new one.
- Every public interface change updates the corresponding tests.
- Run the existing test suite before calling a task complete, and say plainly
  what you ran. New behaviour gets a test; a bug fix gets a regression test.
- Tests must be deterministic — no sleeps, no network, no reliance on
  wall-clock time.

## Finding your unknowns

Output quality on a non-trivial task is bounded by how well the ambiguities got
resolved — and most of them surface *during* implementation, not before it. So
treat unknown-hunting as part of the work, not a phase that ends at the plan:

- Before building: name what you don't know. Prefer a reference in **code** — an
  existing implementation to mirror, a failing test, a rubric, an HTML mockup —
  over a prose description of the same thing.
- While building: keep a running note of decisions that departed from the plan
  and edge cases you hit. Surface them; don't silently absorb them.
- After building: be able to explain what changed and why it is correct.
- Durable findings go in the **repo**, not in agent memory — an environment
  quirk, non-obvious wiring, where a source of truth actually lives, a
  sequencing constraint. Repo files version with the code and every person and
  every harness that opens the repo sees them; agent memory is per-agent and is
  silently missed by the next session. A fleet-wide rule goes in
  `_agent-guidance`'s `agents-md/base.md`, a repo fact below the
  `## Repo-specific additions` marker, a reusable procedure into the skills
  registry. A memory note is a supplement, never the only copy.

The full workflow (blind-spot pass, self-interview, implementation notes,
post-hoc explainer) is the **`finding-unknowns`** skill in the registry. Reach
for it on unfamiliar code, a new domain, or anything with subjective acceptance
criteria.

## Workstation layout

Repo locations are host-specific — match the convention of the machine you're on
(on Windows, check `$env:COMPUTERNAME`).

- **`ZENDA`** (Windows): local clones live under `D:\repos\<github-owner-or-org>\<repo>`
  (for example `D:\repos\adam-s-daniel\wsl-automation`). Clone new repos there, and
  assume existing repos live there rather than under the user profile
  (`C:\Users\<user>\...`).

## Sessions get cut off

**`ZENDA` drops sessions mid-task, frequently.** Assume any run can end between
one tool call and the next, and keep the work recoverable throughout rather
than only at the end.

- **Commit and push as you go**, on a branch. A pushed branch survives the
  laptop; the conversation, a dirty tree and a worktree do not — a worktree can
  be deleted with the session that made it. Small commits *are* the checkpoint.
- **Persist the expensive part**, which is the investigation and not the diff:
  the root cause, the baseline test result, the option already ruled out. A
  fresh session can regenerate a patch quickly; it cannot cheaply re-derive why
  the obvious fix was wrong. Put it in the commit message, the PR body, or an
  ADR — all of which outlive the context window. Chat does not.
- **Say where things stand before a long step** — a full test suite, a CI
  watch, a wide refactor — so a resumed session starts from a statement of what
  is done and what is next, not a reconstruction of it.
- **Report a resume pointer, not just an outcome:** branch, PR number, worktree
  path, and the next command to run.

## Security

Standard practice applies without being restated here. These are the ones with
teeth in this account:

- Validate anything that crosses a trust boundary — user input, API responses,
  file contents.
- Never build SQL, shell commands, or HTML by string-concatenating untrusted
  data. Use parameterized queries, shell arrays, and context-aware escaping.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or `.env` files.
- Never disable TLS verification, authentication, or CSRF protection.

## Data exposure in CI and public repos

Treat CI run logs, job summaries, artifacts, workflow run pages, and git history
as **public** on a public repo. (Real incident: a workflow printed the owner's
email addresses and their correspondents' into a public Actions log.)

- **Never print personal or sensitive data to a log** — no emails, contacts,
  names, IDs, mailbox sizes/counts, tokens, or anything "useful to an attacker or
  scammer." Deliver sensitive results out-of-band (e.g. email the account itself,
  write to a private store) and log only a non-identifying status line.
- **Don't interpolate `${{ inputs.* }}` / `${{ github.event.* }}` into a `run:`
  block** — the rendered command is echoed to the log. Read inputs from
  `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` inside the script and `::add-mask::` sensitive values
  before use. `::add-mask::` only scrubs the log *stream*, not other surfaces.
- **Put sensitive config in secrets, not plaintext inputs or `vars`.** Only
  secret *values* are masked in logs.
- **Sanitize error output** — never dump an API/HTTP response body on failure (it
  can quote personal data); reduce it to a status code + machine error type, and
  keep the data-bearing serialization/call inside the try/catch.
- **Least privilege:** set `permissions:` to the minimum (usually
  `contents: read`) and require approval for outside-collaborator fork PRs.
- **Test fixtures use reserved `example.com` / `example.net` domains only** —
  never a real address; fixtures get committed and logged.

### git history & metadata
- **Sanitize before the first commit.** Fixing the current file does not remove
  data from history. If sensitive data was committed, rewrite history to drop the
  commits, delete every ref that points at them (branches, tags, **PRs**), and
  force-push. GitHub garbage-collects unreachable objects on its own schedule
  (days to weeks) — until then they remain reachable *by SHA* — and you can ask
  GitHub Support to expedite for a public repo. (This is the deliberate exception
  to "don't force-push"; it is a security remediation.)
- **Commit with the GitHub `…@users.noreply.github.com` identity** on public
  repos so a real email is not baked into commit author/committer metadata.

## Automation vs branch protection

Fleet repos enforce PR-only default branches via ruleset, managed as code in
`repo-settings` (see its ADR 0001). Design automation accordingly:

- Never design a bot that pushes to a protected default branch ad hoc — the
  push is rejected (GH013), even from the repo's own workflows.
- Generated data (badges, run summaries, reports, dashboards) belongs on a
  dedicated unprotected results branch (e.g. skills-evals' `eval-results`);
  consumers read from that branch and treat its content as untrusted.
- The rare bot that genuinely must write to a default branch needs a ruleset
  bypass actor declared in repo-settings' `fleet.yml` — never a hand-granted
  UI bypass (the drift report flags those). The AGENTS.md sync App is the
  standing example.
- PR + auto-merge is not a sanctioned bot-write path for fleet repos; the
  cms-platform-managed repos (outside the fleet ruleset) use it by their own
  design.

### A required status check gets no `concurrency` group

A job that publishes a **required** status context and can fire more than once
on the same head sha — label events, an `opened` + `synchronize` burst, any
multi-event trigger — gets no `concurrency` block at all.

- GitHub picks **non-deterministically** between a cancelled run and a
  successful one for the same context + sha. When cancelled wins the PR is hard
  blocked: the merge API returns `405 Required status check "<ctx>" is
  cancelled`, and nothing overrides it — not native auto-merge, not an explicit
  merge call, not a nudge bot. The PR looks all-green and simply never lands.
- **`cancel-in-progress: false` is not "run them all."** GitHub keeps the
  in-progress run plus only the *latest* pending run in the group and cancels
  the other pending duplicates, so a same-sha burst still leaves cancelled runs
  behind. Flipping that flag is the fix that looks right and changes nothing.
- Same mechanic on any shared lane: when one push drives two workflows into one
  group, the older pending sibling is cancelled. Make the triggers pairwise
  disjoint — a shared group only serialises runs that already arrive apart.
- Jobs triggered only by `push` / `synchronize` — each a new sha — are safe to
  cancel and keep `cancel-in-progress: true`.
- Lock the invariant with a test that **parses** the workflow YAML (the `yaml`
  package — never a regex or line scan, which reads clean on text it cannot
  see), so the block cannot come back.

## Two GitHub connectors, and which one you are holding

A session here can see **two** GitHub MCP servers at once. They authenticate as
the same person, so `get_me` will not tell them apart, and the tool names do
not say which is which. Establish it before you reach for one:

- **`mcp__github__*` — session-provisioned.** It does NOT appear in
  `ListConnectors`; the remote environment supplies it and the session's own
  system prompt points at it. It is the **only** one with GitHub Actions tools
  (`actions_list`, `actions_get`, `actions_run_trigger`), CI introspection
  (`get_check_run`, `get_job_logs`), auto-merge control, and review-thread
  resolution. Its reach is the session's attached repositories; `add_repo`
  widens it mid-session.
- **`mcp__b26ebb34-…__*` — the claude.ai org connector `github-mcp`.** It lists
  in `ListConnectors` as `connected: true`. Its tool set is a **strict subset**
  of the above: same reads, same PR and issue writes, same `merge_pull_request`,
  `push_files` and `delete_file` — and no Actions, no job logs, no auto-merge,
  no review threads. Its reach comes from a GitHub App installation allowlist
  that is INDEPENDENT of the session's attached repos.

Three consequences, and the first is why this section sits where it does:

- **Everything that verifies CI is `mcp__github__`-only.** Dispatching a run,
  reading a rollup, pulling a failed job's log — the org connector can do none
  of it. A session holding only `github-mcp` cannot follow the rule below at
  all: it can merge a pull request but it cannot check one.
- **Fewer tools is not less dangerous.** Both connectors merge, push and
  delete. The subset one is the connector whose reach you cannot infer from the
  session's repo list, so a write through it can land somewhere the session was
  never scoped to. Measured 2026-08-19: `github-mcp` 404s on the private
  `repo-settings` even though the account can push there, while both read a
  public non-attached repo fine.
- **A 404 means "not visible to THIS connector"** — never that a repo or file
  does not exist. Re-check on the other one before concluding anything; the
  next section is how to tell the two apart.

Prefer `mcp__github__` for everything. Reach for `github-mcp` only when the
other genuinely cannot see a repo, and say so out loud when you do. When you
report a verification, name the connector it came from.

## A GitHub 404 means "not authorized", not "not there"

GitHub answers **404 rather than 403** when a caller is not authorized to know a
private repo exists — it will not confirm the repo either way. So a 404 from any
GitHub API or MCP call is ambiguous by design: either the thing is gone, or the
credential simply lacks that repo. The body says "Not Found" in both cases,
which is why the wrong reading — telling someone their PR was deleted — is the
easy one to reach for.

- **Probe the repo, not the object.** If `GET /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls` 404s
  as well, the whole repo is invisible to that credential: a scope gap, not a
  missing PR. If the repo answers and only the object 404s, it is genuinely
  gone.
- **Try the other connector before concluding anything.** The two servers above
  do not share an installation, so one can be blind to a repo the other reads
  fine. (Real incident, 2026-08-19: a mid-session MCP reconnect brought up a
  second GitHub server whose credential could not see a private repo. Every call
  against it 404ed — including on a PR the *other* connector had read
  successfully minutes earlier — and the repo was neither deleted nor unshared.
  `add_repo` reported it already attached, which is about session scope and does
  not widen a connector's own installation.)
- **Git is a separate credential path** and often still works when the API
  token does not. `git ls-remote origin '<ref>'` answers "does this branch
  exist"; `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main` answers "was it
  merged". Neither touches the API, so both stay available to report real state
  while a connector is blind.
- Never report a repo, PR, or branch as gone on a 404 alone. Say which
  credential could not see it, and what you checked with.

## "The watch finished" is not "CI passed"

Never read CI pass/fail off a watch command's exit code, or off the fact that it
returned. Three failure modes stack: in `cmd | tail` the shell's `$?` is
`tail`'s — always 0 — masking the non-zero from `gh pr checks`; a backgrounded
watch reports that same pipeline code, so its "completed (exit code 0)"
notification says nothing about the build; and `tail -N` can show only the
passing and skipping lines while the FAILURE lines scrolled out of the window,
so eyeballing it looks green too. (Real incident: all three lined up on one PR —
e2e and lint were FAILURE while the session reported CI green and moved on.)

- Capture the real code with `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`, or don't pipe the watch at all.
- After **any** CI watch, query the conclusions explicitly and report the parsed
  result before acting on it:

  ```bash
  gh pr view <n> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json statusCheckRollup --jq \
    '.statusCheckRollup[] | (.conclusion // .state) as $c
     | select($c != null and $c != "SUCCESS" and $c != "NEUTRAL")
     | "\(.name // .context): \($c)"'
  ```

  A check run carries `.conclusion`, a legacy commit status carries `.state` —
  filter on only one and the other's failures read as clean.
- Treat "watch done" as "now verify", never as "passed". Don't launch a watch
  and go passive without a definite verify-the-rollup step on resume.

## Dependency updates

Dependabot runs with a **minimum package age** (`cooldown`) so an unattended
merge still gets a cooling-off period: `default-days: 7`, `semver-major-days: 30`.
Two things about that setting are easy to get wrong:

- It applies to **version** updates only. A security advisory bypasses cooldown
  entirely and opens immediately — the wait never delays a vulnerability fix.
- An unset `cooldown` is **not** "no wait": GitHub applies an implicit 3-day
  minimum age to version updates. Writing 7 is a raise from 3, not from zero.

`semver-minor-days` / `semver-patch-days` are deliberately left undefined —
they fall back to `default-days`, and spelling them out only invites drift.

The window is not only Dependabot's. A package you add or bump **by hand** mid-task
is the case with no automation watching it: check the publish date
(`npm view <pkg> time --json`), take the newest release that has already cleared
the 7 days rather than the freshest one, and pin it exact (no caret) so `npm ci`
cannot drift onto a version that has had no cooling-off at all.

## A name you choose becomes data a scanner reads

gitleaks' `generic-api-key` rule fires on a **keyword** next to a
high-entropy value. The keyword list is short and ordinary:

```
access  auth  api  credential  creds  key  passwd  password  secret  token
```

Nothing warns you that those words are reserved, because they are not — they
are only reserved *in the position a scanner looks at*. Name a skill, a config
key, a job output, an artifact or a fixture with one of them, and every
generated file that serialises `name: value` alongside a hash, id or digest
starts looking like a leak.

That is not hypothetical. A skill named **`cms-platform-secrets`** put the line
`"cms-platform/cms-platform-secrets": "<64-hex>"` into `skills.lock`, which is
generated, committed, and scanned. Both consumer sites went red on every push
to `main` — adamdaniel.ai for eight consecutive pushes, each one a blocked
editorial publish. An audit of all 34 skill names across both registries found
exactly one hit: that name. One word, one outage.

The shape that makes it hard to catch:

- **The repo that chooses the name is not the repo that breaks.** cms-platform
  named the skill; the two sites that install its bundle are what went red.
  cms-platform's own lock lists only `adam/*` skills, so it stayed green and
  the author had no signal at all.
- **A pull request cannot see it.** The PR lane scans `base..head`; the push,
  schedule and dispatch lanes scan full history. A finding that lives in an
  older commit is invisible to every PR and fires on every push.
- **History is immutable, so the name outlives the rename.** Fixing the
  generator or renaming the skill fixes the working tree and nothing else. The
  old line stays in every clone until history is rewritten.

So:

- **Check a name against that list before you commit to it**, whenever the name
  will land in a generated or serialised artifact. It costs one grep. Prefer a
  name that says what the thing is for over one that names the sensitive noun —
  `consumer-repo-provisioning` carries the same meaning as
  `cms-platform-secrets` and trips nothing.
- **Fix it at the source, not with an allowlist.** An allowlist entry is
  per-repo; a `.gitleaksignore` fingerprint is `<commit>:<file>:<rule>:<line>`
  and commit shas are repo-unique, so it cannot be propagated *at all* — copied
  to another repo it names a commit that does not exist there and silently
  suppresses nothing while looking like coverage. One rename immunises every
  consumer at once; N exclusions immunise N repos until the next one adopts.
- **Do not lean on a scanner's internals.** Labelling a digest `sha256:<hex>`
  currently dodges the rule because `:` falls outside its capture class — a
  welcome side effect, and a bad thing to depend on. Justify such a label as
  self-documentation (it says which algorithm produced the digest); if the
  upstream regex ever widens, every lock in the fleet goes red at once.
- **Suppress by value, never by path.** A `paths` entry does not filter
  findings, it skips the file before any rule runs, so a real credential pasted
  into it is never reported (cms-platform#260 — 29KB of a public repo left
  unscanned that way, suppressing nothing that the value regexes did not
  already cover).

## Pinning GitHub Actions

**Every `uses:` is pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA** — in workflows,
composite actions, and reusable-workflow references alike, with exactly one
carve-out, named below. Never a tag, never a branch, never an abbreviated SHA. A
tag is a movable pointer: pinning to one gives whoever can retag the upstream
repo a shell on the runner, holding that job's token.

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1 (2023-10-17)
```

- **The trailing `# vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` comment is part of the pin.** Forty hex
  characters say nothing on their own; the version says what it is and the date
  says how stale it is. Dependabot rewrites the SHA and the version but not the
  date, so dates drift — cosmetic, a chore, never an incident.
- **Wait 7 days after a release before adopting it** — the cooling-off above,
  applied by hand. If the newest release is younger than that, pin the previous
  one.
- **Dereference annotated tags.** `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/ref/tags/<tag>`
  returning `.object.type == "tag"` gives you the tag object's SHA, not the
  commit's, and pinning that fails at runtime. Follow it with
  `git/tags/<that-sha>`, or ask git directly:
  `git ls-remote <url> 'refs/tags/<tag>^{}'`.
- **The one carve-out: a reusable *workflow* from a repo this account owns stays
  on a tag.** `uses: Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/.github/workflows/<x>.yml@v0.1.85`
  is correct as written — do not "fix" it to a SHA. The tag is the platform's
  release identity: `platform-bump.yml` moves the `uses:@` refs, the theme gem,
  `platform.lock` and every `platform_ref:` input to one release in a single PR,
  and `check-platform-pin-consistency.js` asserts each of those refs equals
  `platform.lock`'s `platform_ref` — a SHA there fails the lint and strands the
  bump. It stops there: the platform's own composite actions under
  `.github/actions/` take a SHA and the usual `# vX.Y.Z` comment, and nothing
  third-party is ever a tag.
- `./local/path` and `docker://` refs have nothing to pin. Leave them.

`sha_pinning_required: true` enforces the rule at the repo level — set by
`repo-settings`' `fleet.yml` for the fleet and `cms-platform`'s
`repo-settings.yml` for the three sites it manages. It governs **actions**, not
reusable-workflow refs: adamdaniel.ai and jodidaniel.com were already enforcing
it at the 2026-07-13 audit and still call 32 tag-pinned cms-platform reusables
apiece, and four repos on the `fleet.yml` default call one each. That is what
makes the carve-out workable — and what leaves a tag in a *third-party* reusable
ref for review, not the setting, to catch.

## Subagent delegation (model routing)

- Don't write code in the main loop: run the implementation in a subagent on an
  appropriately lower-power model (e.g. the Agent tool's `model` override in
  Claude Code; skip if the harness has no subagent support).
- Route by mechanicalness: smallest model (haiku-class) for exactly-specified
  edits — pin bumps, renames, config/doc tweaks; mid-tier (sonnet-class) for
  normal implementation from a clear spec. Escalate rather than ship a wrong
  diff when the task is genuinely subtle (cross-repo invariants, race
  conditions).
- The main loop keeps root-cause investigation, architectural decisions,
  writing the spec, and review of the subagent's diff before commit.
- Delegated work is done when a **verifier exits 0**, not when the report reads
  as finished. Name the exact command in the spec and require its exit code
  back. A subagent that cannot run it reports BLOCKED; a count that disagrees
  with the spec's stated expectation is a stop-and-report condition, never a
  rounding difference.
- Don't assume the subagent sees this file: general-purpose and custom
  subagents receive the full memory hierarchy (imports included), but
  Explore/Plan-type agents and SDK harnesses with `settingSources: []` skip
  repo guidance entirely. Restate load-bearing constraints (style, test
  command, invariants) in the delegation prompt, and don't hand
  guidance-sensitive work to agents that won't see it.
- **Any prompt that sends a subagent to live-test states the credential
  boundary** — which `HOME`/profile it may use, what it may read, and that it
  must not copy real credentials anywhere to make the test pass. (Real
  incident: a reviewer live-testing a plugin migration in a scratch `HOME`
  copied the account's real OAuth credentials into it. The test worked; nobody
  had asked, and nothing in the prompt forbade it.)
- Supply a throwaway credential, or scope the test to what runs
  unauthenticated. If it genuinely cannot run without a real one, that is the
  operator's call — not a gap for the subagent to close on its own initiative.

## Skills ecosystem

- The canonical skills registry is `github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/agentskills`,
  organized as three bundle plugins — `adam` (general-purpose, cloud-safe;
  default-on), `adam-local` (machine-bound), and `fastmail` — each holding
  `skills/<skill>/` directories.
- In Claude Code with the marketplace installed, invoke a skill as
  `/adam:<skill>` (e.g. `/adam:finding-unknowns`).
- Local machines get the marketplace plus per-agent symlinks via that repo's
  `setup.sh`.
- Cloud/ephemeral sessions still get **no** plugins from repo-declared
  settings — that Claude Code limitation (agentskills' `docs/decisions/0001`)
  is unchanged. What changed is that it now has a fix: a repo carrying its own
  `skills.lock` plus the `skills-bootstrap` SessionStart hook installs the
  bundles that lock names directly into those sessions, verified against a
  pinned commit and per-skill digests. Such a session opens with a `skills:`
  verdict naming what loaded, or why nothing did — read it instead of guessing.
- **Adoption is opt-in and double-keyed, and no longer rare.** Delivery needs
  an allowlist entry in `_agent-guidance`'s `repos.yml` AND a `skills.lock` the
  repo committed itself — the fleet sync never writes one, because the lock is
  where a repo declares which bundles it installs (some federate several
  registries). A repo holds both keys, or is mid-adoption holding one, or is
  deliberately out for a reason — a propagation experiment the bundle would
  contaminate, a dormant repo whose sessions never happen. Which of the three
  fits an unfamiliar repo is not guessable: look for `skills.lock`. Bundles
  cost always-on context in every session that carries them, which is why this
  stays a deliberate per-repo decision and not a fleet default.
- New reusable skills graduate **into** the registry (sensitive ones into
  `agentskills-private`) rather than living on in a consumer repo. A long skill
  splits across files rather than growing into one wall of text.

## Git practices

- Write concise commit messages that explain *why*, not just *what*.
- One logical change per commit.
- Do not amend published commits or force-push shared branches.
- **Merge with a merge commit — `gh pr merge --merge`.** Squash and rebase are
  disabled on every fleet repo, so `--squash` fails rather than falling back;
  do not try it, and do not offer it as a choice. The exceptions are the three
  cms-platform-managed repos (`cms-platform`, `adamdaniel.ai`,
  `jodidaniel.com`), where squash stays enabled because the Decap publish chain
  arms SQUASH auto-merge on every editorial PR and squash is what collapses an
  editor's many per-save commits into one `publish: <title>` commit. Merge
  commits work there too, so `--merge` is the one form that works everywhere.

  Squash is off elsewhere because it is actively unsafe for a repo that pins
  commits by sha: it collapses a branch into a new commit and strands the
  originals on no branch, so a lockfile naming the pre-merge content commit
  (agentskills' `skills.lock`) ends up pinning something a fresh clone of the
  default branch does not contain. Measured on throwaway clones 2026-08-15 —
  `generate_skills_lock.py --check` then fails with `cannot resolve ref`.
  Settings are enforced as code: `repo-settings`' `fleet.yml` for the fleet,
  `cms-platform`'s `repo-settings.yml` for the three above.

## Repo-specific additions

<!-- Add your repo-specific agent guidance below this line -->

### Architecture Decision Records

Non-obvious policy decisions are recorded in
[docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/README.md). Read the relevant ADR before
proposing to revert a policy — start with ADR 0001 (how bots write to
protected branches).

### Merge-setting fields go missing on a low-scope token

- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` returns the **merge-setting** fields —
  `allow_merge_commit`, `allow_squash_merge`, `allow_rebase_merge`,
  `allow_auto_merge`, `delete_branch_on_merge` — only to a token with
  write-level access to the repo's contents. Below that the keys are **absent**,
  not `false`. Non-merge fields (`has_wiki`, `default_branch`), rulesets and
  `actions/permissions` stay visible, so the token looks perfectly alive.
- The engine therefore treats an absent key as an informational **skip**, never
  as drift and never as a `KeyError`. Keep it that way: a `KeyError` there
  escapes both `plan_repo`'s `GhError` guard and `plan_repo_records`, taking the
  whole fleet run down over one repo's payload. Never "fix" it by promoting an
  absent key to drift.
- Consequence for CI: while the fan-out App is scoped Administration + Actions +
  Metadata (README, "CI fan-out" step 1), the scheduled run cannot audit or
  reconcile the merge-method policy — those records come back as skips, and
  merge-method drift is caught only by an operator `apply` under ambient
  `gh auth`. Accept that gap knowingly, or widen the App and **verify** the keys
  actually appear before trusting the audit again.
- Never probe a read-scoped token by asking for `.delete_branch_on_merge` — an
  absent key reads exactly like a dead token. Probe with
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/permissions --jq .enabled`.

### Pull before you apply

- `repo_settings.py apply` is a **converging** writer: it makes the fleet match
  the checkout it runs from. `write_ruleset` PUTs the whole desired body, so a
  stale checkout silently reverts everything merged since — a `bypass_actors`
  grant added on `main` is stripped the moment someone applies from a branch
  that predates it, with no error and no drift to show for it.
- So: `git pull` immediately before any local `apply`, and after a failed or
  partial run re-run from current `main` rather than assuming the legs that
  already passed are still good.
- Same hazard from the workflow: `workflow_dispatch` executes the engine and
  `fleet.yml` **of the ref you dispatch**, not of `main`. Dispatch from `main`
  unless you are deliberately testing a branch — a dispatch on a stale branch
  produces a convincing, wrong audit.

### A stray ruleset defeats a declared bypass

- GitHub enforces the **union** of every ruleset on a repo, and a bypass actor
  exempts only the ruleset that grants it. A leftover hand-made ruleset with an
  empty `bypass_actors` therefore blocks the declared bypass App **and** admins,
  even while `fleet.yml`'s managed ruleset grants both.
- The engine is idempotent **by name** and never touches rulesets it does not
  own (`schema.md`), so a stray never surfaces as drift. The symptom is a bot
  still taking GH013 after its grant applied cleanly and `diff` reports
  converged — that is the signature of a second ruleset, not a bug in the grant.
- Before declaring a repo onboarded — especially one that already carried
  protection by hand — enumerate its rulesets and delete the strays:
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rulesets --jq '.[] | "\(.id) \(.name)"'`.
  Deletion stays manual and deliberate; the engine will not do it for you.
