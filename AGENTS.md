## General guidelines

- Read existing code before modifying it. Understand the patterns already in use.
- Keep changes minimal and focused — fix what was asked, nothing more.
- Do not add speculative features, premature abstractions, or unused helpers.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files.

## Workstation layout

Repo locations are host-specific — match the convention of the machine you're on
(on Windows, check `$env:COMPUTERNAME`).

- **`ZENDA`** (Windows): local clones live under `D:\repos\<github-owner-or-org>\<repo>`
  (for example `D:\repos\adam-s-daniel\wsl-automation`). Clone new repos there, and
  assume existing repos live there rather than under the user profile
  (`C:\Users\<user>\...`).

## Code quality

- Follow the idioms and style already established in this repo.
- Write code that is clear enough to not need comments; add comments only when intent is non-obvious.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless strictly necessary.
- Every public interface change should include corresponding test updates.

## Security

- Validate all external input (user input, API responses, file contents).
- Never construct SQL, shell commands, or HTML by string concatenation with untrusted data.
- Use parameterized queries, shell arrays, and context-aware escaping respectively.
- Do not disable TLS verification, authentication, or CSRF protection.

## Data exposure in CI and public repos

Treat CI run logs, job summaries, artifacts, workflow run pages, and git history
as **public** on a public repo. (Real incident: a workflow printed the owner's
email addresses and their correspondents' into a public Actions log.)

- **Never print personal or sensitive data to a log** — no emails, contacts,
  names, IDs, mailbox sizes/counts, tokens, or anything "useful to an attacker or
  scammer." Deliver sensitive results out-of-band (e.g. email the account itself,
  write to a private store) and log only a non-identifying status line.
- **Don't interpolate `${{ inputs.* }}` / `${{ github.event.* }}` into a `run:`
  block** — the rendered command is echoed to the log. Read inputs from
  `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` inside the script and `::add-mask::` sensitive values
  before use. `::add-mask::` only scrubs the log *stream*, not other surfaces.
- **Put sensitive config in secrets, not plaintext inputs or `vars`.** Only
  secret *values* are masked in logs.
- **Sanitize error output** — never dump an API/HTTP response body on failure (it
  can quote personal data); reduce it to a status code + machine error type, and
  keep the data-bearing serialization/call inside the try/catch.
- **Least privilege:** set `permissions:` to the minimum (usually
  `contents: read`) and require approval for outside-collaborator fork PRs.
- **Test fixtures use reserved `example.com` / `example.net` domains only** —
  never a real address; fixtures get committed and logged.

### git history & metadata
- **Sanitize before the first commit.** Fixing the current file does not remove
  data from history. If sensitive data was committed, rewrite history to drop the
  commits, delete every ref that points at them (branches, tags, **PRs**), and
  force-push. GitHub garbage-collects unreachable objects on its own schedule
  (days to weeks) — until then they remain reachable *by SHA* — and you can ask
  GitHub Support to expedite for a public repo. (This is the deliberate exception
  to "don't force-push"; it is a security remediation.)
- **Commit with the GitHub `…@users.noreply.github.com` identity** on public
  repos so a real email is not baked into commit author/committer metadata.

## Testing

- Run the existing test suite before considering a task complete.
- New behavior requires new tests; bug fixes require regression tests.
- Tests should be deterministic — no sleeping, no network calls, no reliance on wall-clock time.

## Subagent delegation (model routing)

- Don't write code in the main loop: run the implementation in a subagent on an
  appropriately lower-power model (e.g. the Agent tool's `model` override in
  Claude Code; skip if the harness has no subagent support).
- Route by mechanicalness: smallest model (haiku-class) for exactly-specified
  edits — pin bumps, renames, config/doc tweaks; mid-tier (sonnet-class) for
  normal implementation from a clear spec.
- The main loop keeps root-cause investigation, architectural decisions,
  writing the spec, and review of the subagent's diff before commit.
- Escalate the model rather than ship a wrong diff when the task is genuinely
  subtle (cross-repo invariants, race conditions).
- Don't assume the subagent sees this file: general-purpose and custom
  subagents receive the full memory hierarchy (imports included), but
  Explore/Plan-type agents and SDK harnesses with `settingSources: []` skip
  repo guidance entirely. Restate load-bearing constraints (style, test
  command, invariants) in the delegation prompt, and don't hand
  guidance-sensitive work to agents that won't see it.
- Give the subagent a precise spec — files, exact changes, house style, the
  test command to run. Subagent output is gated by the same test/CI proof as
  any other change.

## Skills ecosystem

- The canonical skills registry is `github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/agentskills`,
  organized as three bundle plugins — `adam` (general-purpose, cloud-safe;
  default-on), `adam-local` (machine-bound), and `fastmail` — each holding
  `skills/<skill>/` directories.
- In Claude Code with the marketplace installed, invoke a skill as
  `/adam:<skill>` (e.g. `/adam:pin-actions-to-sha`).
- Local machines get the marketplace plus per-agent symlinks via that repo's
  `setup.sh`.
- Cloud sessions currently get **no** plugins from repo-declared settings — a
  known Claude Code limitation (see agentskills' `docs/decisions/0001`) — so
  don't assume bundle skills are available there.
- New reusable skills graduate **into** the registry (sensitive ones into
  `agentskills-private`) rather than living on in a consumer repo.

## Git practices

- Write concise commit messages that explain *why*, not just *what*.
- One logical change per commit.
- Do not amend published commits or force-push shared branches.
